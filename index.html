										<h2 class="major">Why I'm Here</h2>
										<p>During my three years as an educator I enjoyed discovering new technologies to engage my students and streamline their learning process. Though when I needed a tool that didn't exist I decided to make it myself and thus began teaching myself how to code. While learning, my passion for the craft grew and at the end of the school year I decided to pursue a full time career in web development.</p>

										<h2 class="major">What I've learned</h2>
										<p>I've always taken my education into my own hands and web development was no exception. I've utilized many 'self-paced' courses to gain the skills needed to be a proficient developer. I used the platform SoloLearn to learn HTML / CSS / JS. Then mastered Node, Events, APIs, Webpack, and HTTP requests with Udacity. Finally to round off my web developer toolkit I completed the Wes Bos React course, which covered state, components, props, and hooks.  </p>

										<h2 class="major">What I want</h2>
										<p>My goal is to work with a team of developers who push and support each other. As an educator I've seen firsthand how cooperation can make or break a department, and I'm determined to be a part of a cohesive unit. I want to rely on others, and I want others to rely on me. </p>
